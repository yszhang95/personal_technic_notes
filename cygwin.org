#+Title: Cygwin related stuffs
* Users and groups
** =HOME= directory
   See this [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1494658/how-can-i-change-my-cygwin-home-folder-after-installation][post]]. Modifiy the file =/etc/nsswitch.conf=.
   Change the line for =db_home=. I change this line because
   I found =Cygwin= misunderstand what is =${HOME}= sometimes.
   =${HOME}= will be expanded to =/cygdrive/c/Users/zysri= or
   =/home/zysri=. According to the user guide of =Cygwin=, I
   supposed that it should be =/cygdrive/c/Users/zysri= since
   =Cygwin= would like to use windows-exisiting environment
   variables.
