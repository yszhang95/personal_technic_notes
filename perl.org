#+TITLE: Perl tips
* One-line phraser
** =grep= and =sed= print
   Try =perl -ne 'print if /pattern/' input.txt=. For find in
   a range and print, try
   =perl -ne 'print if (m/PatternA/..m/PatternB/)'=.
** =sed= replacement
   To replace the original string with the new in a specific range,
   try =perl -ne 's/this/that/g if (m/PatternA/..m/PatternB/)'=.
   I never try other cases without specificing a range.
