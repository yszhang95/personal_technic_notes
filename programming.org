#+TITLE: Programming stuffs
* Executables and libaries
  Only the executables and libraries in format of Executable and
  Linking Format (ELF) are discussed.
** Three types of program libraries
   - Static
   - Shared
   - dynamical loaded (DL): can be either static or shared libraries.
** Static libraries
   Static libraries are a collection of ordinary object files, ending
   with the =.a= suffix. The tool =ar= (meaning archiver) help you
   create static libraries. Here is an example:
   #+begin_src shell
   ar rcs my_library.a file1.o file2.o
   #+end_src
   For more info please see the manual of ar via =man ar= and have a
   look at section =OPTIONS=.
** Shared libraries
   Shared libraries are libraries loaded when the programs start.
