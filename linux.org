* Text manipulation
** =sed=
*** Print
    Try =/pattern/p=.
    #+begin_example
    sed -n "/^#/p" input_file # -n help you supress the output
    #+end_example
*** Replacement
    Try =s/pattern/replacement/option=. And you can preceed address
    (=man sed=) to =s=. Here, =option= can be =g=, similar to =vim=.
    =pattern= is written in format of regular expression.  You can use
    =&= and =\1= to =\9= to denote the matched portion of =pattern= in
    =replacement=.  For instance, if you want to replace =-= in the
    first part of =1-2-3-4 1E-10=. Let us do the following,
    #+begin_src shell
    cat > example.txt
    1-2-3-4 1E-10
    ^D
    sed -E 's/([^E])-/\1 /g' example.txt # -E or -r means extended-regular-expressions
    #+end_src
*** Scripts
    A simple example of sequential replacement.Supposing that
    we have an example file =example.txt= having the following content,
    #+begin_example
    1-2-3-4 1E-10
    2-3-4-5 2E10
    3-4-5-6 3E-99
    #+end_example
    write in the file
    =sed-example.bash= the following content:
    #+begin_example
      #!/usr/bin/bash
      # or /bin/bash, depending on the system
      # -i means in-place, do not use it if you are not sure you are doing
      # the correct things
      sed -iE '
      1,1s/([^E])-/\1 /g
      2,2s/([^E])-/\1~/g
      3,3s/([^E])-/\1./g
      ' $@
    #+end_example
    And execute ~chmod +x sed-example.bash~ and =./sed-example.bash
    example.txt=. The output will look like
    #+begin_example
    1 2 3 4 1E-10
    2~3~4~5 2E10
    3.4.5.6 3E-99
    #+end_example
