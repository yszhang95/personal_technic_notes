  ~RooAbsPdf~ is the abstract interface for all probability density
  functions. The class provides hybrid analytical/numerical
  normalization for its implementations, error tracing and a MC
  generator interface.
***  A Minimal PDF Implementation
   A minimal implementation of a PDF class derived from ~RooAbsPdf~
   should override the ~evaluate()~ function. This function should
   return the PDF's value (which does not need to be normalized).
**** Normalization/Integration
    Although the normalization of a PDF is an integral part of a
    probability density function, normalization is treated separately
    in RooAbsPdf. The reason is that a ~RooAbsPdf~ object is more than a
    PDF: it can be a building block for a more complex, composite PDF
    if any of its variables are functions instead of variables. In
    such cases the normalization of the composite may not be simply
    the integral over the dependents of the top level PDF as these are
    functions with potentially non-trivial Jacobian terms themselves.

    Therefore, no explicit attempt should be made to normalize the
    function output in ~evaluate()~. In particular, normalization
    constants can be omitted to speed up the function evaluations, and
    included later in the integration of the PDF (see below), which is
    called rarely in comparison to the ~evaluate()~ function.

    In addition, ~RooAbsPdf~ objects do not have a static concept of
    what variables are parameters and what variables are dependents
    (which need to be integrated over for a correct PDF
    normalization). Instead, the choice of normalization is always
    specified each time a normalized value is requested from the PDF
    via the ~getVal()~ method.

    ~RooAbsPdf~ manages the entire normalization logic of each PDF with
    help of a ~RooRealIntegral~ object, which coordinates the
    integration of a given choice of normalization. By default,
    ~RooRealIntegral~ will perform a fully numeric integration of all
    dependents. However, PDFs can advertise one or more (partial)
    analytical integrals of their function, and these will be used by
    ~RooRealIntegral~, if it determines that this is safe (i.e. no
    hidden Jacobian terms, multiplication with other PDFs that have
    one or more dependents in commen etc).

    The integration range for each dependent to be integrated can be
    obtained from the dependent's proxy functions ~min()~ and
    ~max()~. Never call these proxy functions for any proxy not known to
    be a dependent via the integration code. Doing so may be
    ill-defined, e.g. in case the proxy holds a function, and will
    trigger an assert. Integrated category dependents should always be
    summed over all of their states.
**** Direct generation of observables
    Distributions for any PDF can be generated with the accept/reject
    method, but for certain PDFs, more efficient methods may be
    implemented. To implement direct generation of one or more
    observables, two functions need to be implemented, similar to
    those for analytical integrals: ~getGenerator~ and ~generateEvent~.

    The first function advertises observables, for which distributions
    can be generated, similar to the way analytical integrals are
    advertised. The second function implements the actual generator
    for the advertised observables.

    The generated dependent values should be stored in the proxy
    objects. For this, the assignment operator can be used
    (i.e. xProxy = 3.0 ). Never call assign to any proxy not known to
    be a dependent via the generation code. Doing so may be
    ill-defined, e.g. in case the proxy holds a function, and will
    trigger an assert.
**** Batched function evaluations
    To speed up computations with large numbers of data events in
    unbinned fits, it is beneficial to override ~evaluateSpan()~. Like
    this, large spans of computations can be done, without having to
    call ~evaluate()~ for each single data event. ~evaluateSpan()~ should
    execute the same computation as ~evaluate()~, but it may choose an
    implementation that is capable of SIMD computations. If
    ~evaluateSpan~ is not implemented, the classic and slower ~evaluate()~
    will be called for each data event.

   You have several things to do:

- If you want draw with filled area, you must enable
  =DrawOption("F")=. This is because =RooCurve= inherits from =TGraph=.
- In principle, you must add =VLines()= in the arguments for =plotOn=. But
  it does not work until the version 6.26. A work around is below:
  #+begin_src c++
    /**
       A workaround for VLine bug.

       Please check the post https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/unexpected-behavior-of-drawoption-f/44851
       and the PR https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8198

       The function assume the x for points in RooCurve are in increasing
       order. And then, two more points will be placed at the largest x
       and then smallest x. These points then will construct a polygon
       in the filling area.
     ,*/

    void setVLines(RooCurve* curve)
    {
      double xlo = curve->GetPointX(0);
      double xhi = curve->GetPointX(curve->GetN()-1);
      curve->addPoint(xhi, 0);
      curve->addPoint(xlo, 0);
    }
  #+end_src

- If you just want transparent color in output image, do either way as below:
  - Make use of =TColor::GetColorTransparent(kRed, 0.3)= in =RooFit::FillColor=.
    : gaus.plotOn(frame, DrawOption("F"), FillColor(TColor::GetColorTransparent(kRed, 0.3)));
  - Make use of the following blocks:
    : gaus.plotOn(frame, Name("curve_gaus"), DrawOption("F"), FillColor(kRed));
    : auto curve_gaus = frame->getCurve("curve_gaus");
    : curve_gaus->SetFillColorAlpha(kRed, 0.3);

- If you want to show transparency in a ROOT pop-up window, enable
  =OpenGL=. Two ways separately to achieve this:
  - =gStyle->SetCanvasPreferGL->(kTRUE)= in macros.
  - =OpenGL.CanvasPreferGL: 1= in =.rootrc=

 Please consult the [[https://root.cern/doc/master/rf506__msgservice_8C.html][tutorial]] and [[https://root.cern/doc/master/classRooMsgService.html][descriptions]] in reference guide. The
 tutorial shows how to make use of =addStream= to obtain the printout.
 However, I guess I can only find specific level in the output.  For
 example, =addStream(DEBUG, OutputFile("debug.txt"))= will redirect the
 =[#3] DEBUG:= to the =debug.txt=. And =addStream(DEBUG, Topic(Tracing),
 OutputFile("debug.txt"))= will redirect the =[#3] DEBUG:Tracing= to the
 =debug.txt=.

 However, I do /not/ know
 - if it is safe to use the same name at the same time like the
   following:
   : addStream(DEBUG, OutputFile("debug.txt"))
   : addStream(WARNING, OutputFile("debug.txt"))
 - if it will redirect the message along with the higher level message
   together to the output file.

** Options for plotting
   - You can use =RooFit::Range= option in =RooDataSet.plotOn=. I tested
     with =Range("name")= and =Range(low, high)=. The former one
     will give:
     : ERROR: unrecognized command: RangeWithName
     The later one will give:
     : ERROR: unrecognized command: Range
** Generate binned data from unbinned one
   Basically, you could try =binnedClone=. It will produce a
   =RooDataHist=.  I guess the =RooDataHist= is in multi-dimension. This
   might be the reason it will consume a lot of memory resources.

   I usually use =createHistogram= to produce 1-D histogram. There are
   several implementations. Try the one you want. After having the
   histogram object, I create a correspond =RooDataHist=.
** Template fit in RooFit                                                       :NOTE:

As said in the [[https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooHistPdf.html][documentation]]
: The histogram distribution is explicitly normalized by RooHistPdf and can have an arbitrary number of real or discrete dimensions.

I checked the source code in version 6.26/10. The =RooHistPdf= relies on
the its link to =RooDataHist=. The =evaluate= method calculate the value
as suggested in documentation:
: Return the current value: The value of the bin enclosing the current coordinates of the observables, normalized by the histograms contents.
In practice, it makes use of =RooDataHist::weightFast=. See [[https://root.cern.ch/doc/v626/RooHistPdf_8cxx_source.html#l00220][here]]. The
=_unitNorm= flag seems always false.

If you want to use =RooHistPdf=, you must ensure the lifetime of the
input =RooDataSet= linked with =RooHistPdf=. And you also needs to give a
template histogram *without* normalizing it by bin widths.
*** How to create binned dataset?
I have no idea. It seems that creating a dataset from a =TH1= pointer in
constructor will not correct for the bin width by default. See [[https://root.cern.ch/doc/v626/RooDataHist_8cxx_source.html#l00233][here]].
The choice of choose desnsity or counts can be found in =Import=
option. See [[https://root.cern.ch/doc/v626/classRooDataHist.html#a8ea006b2e17e480f6b7ff52b69b04587][here]]. I do not understand their descriptions. I made
several tests:
- Given the histogram with the variable bin size, I do not normalize
  it. And then I tried different method of initializing the dataset:
  - =TH1= pointer: I got the same results using =h->GetBinContent(1)= and
    =dh.weight(0)=.
  - =Import(h, kFALSE=): I got the same results using =h->GetBinContent(1)= and
    =dh.weight(0)=.
  - =Import(h, kTRUE)=: I get the same results using
    =h->GetBinContent(1)*h->GetBinWidth(1)= and =dh.weight(0)=.
  My conclusion is that
  - The correction is done by multiplying the bin content with the bin
    width. This is natural since the dataset should contain
    counts. Note, here it is operation =*=, while in the =weightFast=, the
    =weight= will be divided by bin width if the correction is enabled.
  - Passing =false= to =Import= will yield the same result of histogram
    itself.
- Given the histogram with and without normalization, I tried to plot
  the distributions and generate =RooDataHist=. The histogram with
  =normalization= cannot be drawn properly if =Import(h, kFALSE)= is
  given.

I can convert the dataset to density by hand. But I do not see
significantly differences in the template fit.

I will go with *histogram without normalization* in the template fit
because the plotting is correct only for histograms without
normalizations.

I also do not know how =RooFit= make the plot. It seems that =RooFit=
always plot the density of data.
** A few words for =RooDataHist=
*** Be clear if you will pass the normalized histogram in
I must be careful about the normalization of histograms with uneven
binning.

It is a class holding the "data". I guess the concept drive the design
of this class that it holds the "counts" in =weight= for each bin.

To be consistent with the concept (I may be wrong), I need to do
- Pass the histogram without normalization (=h->Scale(1, "width"=) using
  pointer or =Import(h, kFALSE)=.
- Pass the histogram with normalization using =Import(h, kTRUE)=.

See also the discussion in this [[https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/fitting-and-plotting-variable-bins-histogram-in-roofit/38375][link]]. He made a few examples. I have
not gone through them. I will do it later.
*** Normalization and plotting.
In =RooFit=, =RooDataHist::plotOn= will plot the density of data.
